B.A.T.M.A.N. in Berlin
======================

The first experimental setups using the B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol
daemon have actually started just in parallel with the advent of the
first available implementation. This was also due to the fact that in
2005 most of the dedicated B.A.T.M.A.N. developers lived in Berlin and
always wanted to develop a protocol out of practical experience instead
of theory and paper work.

Since then the number of nodes running B.A.T.M.A.N. and OLSR in parallel
have constantly grown and the first mesh-node administrators have now
started to run a B.A.T.M.A.N.-only stack.

Today, the routing table typically lists entries to about 50 other
B.A.T.M.A.N. interfaces. However, the exact number of mesh-nodes
participating in the Berlin-B.A.T.M.A.N. Cloud is unclear since (not
like OLSR) the protocol only maintains entries and routes to nodes which
are in-fact reachable. Some B.A.T.M.A.N. might just be to much hops away
in order to establish a reasonable connection.

The following links provide a collection to miscellaneous insides to
various Berlin-B.A.T.M.A.N. setups.
