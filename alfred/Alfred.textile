h2. Introduction

alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...

alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert information by using the alfred binary in client mode, or use special programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the information available from all alfred servers in the network.

See the "README":http://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/README for more information or the "manpage":http://downloads.open-mesh.org/batman/manpages/alfred.8.html for usage.

alfred internals are explained in the [[batman-adv:alfred architecture]] document.

h2. Current applications

There are a few applications currently implemented on top of alfred:

h3. batadv-vis

batadv-vis can be used to visualize your batman-adv mesh network. It read the neighbor information and local client table and distributes this information via alfred in the network. By gathering this local information, any vis node can get the whole picture of the network. 

It allows output of different formats (json, graphviz) and replaces the in-kernel vis functionality found in older batman-adv kernel modules (<2014). See the sample picture below. For more information, please read the vis section of the "README":http://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/README  or the "manpage":http://downloads.open-mesh.org/batman/manpages/batadv-vis.html for usage.

h3. alfred-gpsd

Alfred-gpsd can be used to distibute GPS location information about your batman-adv mesh network. This information could be, for example, combined with Vis to visualize your mesh topology with true geographic layout. For mobile or nomadic nodes, Alfred-gpsd, can get location information from gpsd.  Alternatively, a static location can be passed on the command line, which is useful for static nodes without a GPS.

For more information, please read the alfred-gpsd section of the "README":http://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/README or the "manpage":http://downloads.open-mesh.org/batman/manpages/alfred-gpsd.html for usage.

h2. Download

Release tarballs as well as snapshots are available:

 * release tarballs: [[Download#Download-Released-Source-Code|Check the Download page]]
 * git web directory: http://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git
 * git download: git clone git://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git
 * snapshot:http://git.open-mesh.org/alfred.git/snapshot/refs/heads/master.tar.gz

h3. OpenWRT installation from routing feed

Alfred is also part of the routing feed of OpenWRT. For newer OpenWRT, just use:

1. Install the alfred package:

./scripts/feeds install alfred

3. Run "make menuconfig" and select alfred (available under "Network  --->")

h3. OpenWRT development feed

There is also a development packet feed for OpenWRT available for alfred:

1. add the alfred feed by adding the following line into your feeds.conf:

   src-git alfred git://git.open-mesh.org/openwrt-feed-alfred.git

2. Update and install the feed:

 ./scripts/feeds update
./scripts/feeds install alfred

3. Run "make menuconfig" and select alfred (available under "Network  --->")

Finally, re-build Openwrt and enjoy using alfred! :)
