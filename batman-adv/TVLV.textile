h1. BackwardsCompatibility

Everything on this page is a suggestion and therefore open to discussion and change

h2. Intro

Right now batman does not have any  real backwards compatibility.
We could implement real backwards compatibility through the use of IEs(information elements) and more specifically TLVs(type/length/value) elements.

First the closest thing I found in wireless information elements is the wifi ones
For everyone who is not aware of the basics here is a link with a brief and general/abstract description

h2. Main

There are many ways to encode such an element.Each providing different pros/cons and all of which are used in various wireless signal applications.

First one is BER:
This wiki entry describes it pretty godd for a quick overview (and the accompanying paper more thoroughly)
 [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Encoding_Rules]]

Second is DER:[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules]]
 it is more restrictive than the first one

Third PER:[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_Encoding_Rules]]
 defines some more fields

Finally there is Cer:[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Encoding_Rules]]

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1]]

For the record there is already a tlv message parser
[[http://tlve.sourceforge.net/]]
 (the following is an example of ber parsing)

[[http://tlve.sourceforge.net/examples/ber.rc]]

 We can use either one of the above to encode the tlvs or create our
 own but I think one of the above is more than adequate


It is importand that everyone shares his opinion on this because once implemented most of the current functionality should be encoded using tlvs and one of the above methods.
