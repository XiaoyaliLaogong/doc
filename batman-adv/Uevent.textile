h1. Uevent

*DRAFT - TO BE FINISHED*

B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advance can now throw uevents! Thanks to this new feature it is possible to advertise any kind of information to the usespace.
This will probably enable several applications to interact with B.A.T.M.A.N.

*Function prototype:*

<pre>int throw_uevent(struct bat_priv *bat_priv, enum uev_type type, 
                          enum uev_action action, const char *data);</pre>

* type: is the class the uevent belongs to. It is possible to specify new classes into B.A.T.M.A.N. to distinguish between not related uevents
* action: is the class related event that has to be signaled
* data: any meaningful payload that need to be sent to the userspace

*Example:*
* type: GW
* action: ADD/CHANGE/DEL
* data: the gateway MAC address

This is an example of a class of possible uevents to throw to userspace. In case of default gateway change, a uevent is triggered and sent to the userspace with all the needed data. The action field, in this case, represent the event related to the gateway (e.g. ADD: a default gateway for B.A.T.M.A.N. has been found).
