h1. Debian batman-adv AutoStartup

This Page describes how to configure a Debian (or Derived Distribution like Ubuntu, Mint, etc) so that batman-adv starts automatically on boot up.

h2. Load the module
First we need to ensure that the batman-adv module is loaded before we attempt to use it.
Edit /etc/modules and add the batman-adv to a new line in the file
<pre>
>sudo nano /etc/modules
</pre> 
<pre>
># /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
>#
># This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
># at boot time, one per line. Lines begining with '#' are ignored.
>
>batman-adv
>
</pre>
