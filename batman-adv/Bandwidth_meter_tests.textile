h1. Bandwitdh meter tests

In this page some sample result of the bw meter executions are reported. In particular the results are compared with *iperf* and an *HTTP download* to see how much the obtained throughput varies in the different cases.

All the experiments have been executed between two nodes, directly connecteed via wireless ad-hoc. Different devices have been used for the tests. Major details about this are given later.

The scenarios where the tests have been executed are the following:

# bw meter from node to node
# iperf from node to node. Iperf was running on the nodes themselves
# HTTP download from an host behind the first node node to another one behind the second node. In particular:
## host is connected to the Ethernet port of the node
## Ethernet interface is bridged with the batman-adv soft interface

Test in scenarios 1 and 2 were executed alternatively (one bw meter, one iperf, one bw meter, one iperf, ...) while the HTTP downloads have been executed all together later on.

*note:* results given by the http download seem to be wrong. There is probably something wrong in the setup which is slowing everything down.

h2. Environment 1

One OM2P-HS and one OM2P-LC nodes using ath9k based wifi devices connected in ad-hoc mode on *2.4GHz*.
The HS is 802.11n (2x2) capable
The LC is 802.11n (1x1) capable

h3. Results

The table below shows the results in all the 3 scenarios.
All the results are expressed in *Mbps*.

h2. Environment 2

two OM5P node using ath9k based wifi devices connected in ad-hoc mode on *5GHz*.
The OM5P is 802.11n (2x2) capable


h3. Results

The table below shows the results in all the 3 scenarios.
All the results are expressed in *Mbps*.

For this environment, one more scenario has been tested: *iperf host to host*, meaning that an iperf session has been launched between the two hosts connected to the nodes (same configuration as the HTTP download scenario).

*OM5P -> OM5P*
