h1. Distributed ARP Table

+This page is a work in progress. Sorry for beeing uncomplete+

DAT (Distributed ARP Table) is a network-wide ARP cache that helps the clients
in getting ARP responses in a much more reliable way, in particular over sparse
wireless mesh networks. In the latter case, getting a broadcast packet, namely
an ARP request, from the source to the destination would probably require
several retransmission because of the packet loss. DAT aims to improve this
mechanism and to increase the ARP dialogue reliability.

h2. The idea

The DAT core mechanism consists in storing the content of the ARP reply that
travels over the network on a specific set of nodes, known to every other mesh
participant. In this way, whenever a client issues an ARP request, the mesh node
can intercept and forward it directly to the nodes belonging to the specific set
where the corresponding reply is stored. Requests are sent in unicast and
therefore the probability of losing the packet decreases with respect to the
broadcast case.

h2. Enable/Disable DAT

DAT can be compiled in the final binary by means of the customizable Makefile
option or can be left out to save binary space (on by default on the
out-of-the-kernel-tree package).

h2. Inspecting the Local DAT table

Since DAT is a network wide cache, each node stores a little piece of this the
big table. To see whet the current node is currectly storing in the DAT local
cache, it is possible to use the following command:
$$ # batctl dat  $$
