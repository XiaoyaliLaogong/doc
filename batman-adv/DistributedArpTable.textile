h1. Distributed ARP Table

D.A.T. (Distributed ARP Table) is a feature aimed to solve the unreliability problem of the ARP mechanism 
which uses a simple broadcast flooding technique in order to retrieve the the data in the network.

h2. The Problem

In each and every subnet the ARP protocol is extremely important: it gives the hosts the possibility to send IP datagram to each other
by retrieving their MAC-layer address. The first step in an ARP dialogue is to issue a broadcast ARP request containing the IP address of the
desidered node which will flood the whole subnet. Once the node using such IP receives the packet, a unicast ARP Reply is sent back
in order to communicate its own MAC-layer address and so becoming reachable for the node that issued the request.

The mechanism is pretty simple and works well until the probability of losing packets in the network is low enough. For this reason Ethernet or
wireless-infrastructured LANcan use such protocol as is without getting in troubles. Unluckily it is not possible to state the same for a wireless
mesh network, where the probability of losing a packet increase with the number of links the packet has to traverse. In particular, this probability
gets higher if the packet to send is of type broadcast (this is due to the MAC layer limitations which do not provide ARQ mechanism for this packet type)
like the ARP Request. Assuming to be in a fairly sparse wireless mesh network, an ARP Request could get lost several times before being able to find
its destination, thus dramatically increasing the latency of establishing an IP connection.
