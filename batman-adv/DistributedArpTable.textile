h1. Distributed ARP Table

+This page is a work in progress. Sorry for being uncomplete+

DAT (Distributed ARP Table) is a network-wide ARP cache that helps the clients
in getting ARP responses in a much more reliable way, in particular over sparse
wireless mesh networks. In the latter case, getting a broadcast packet, namely
an ARP request, from the source to the destination would probably require
several retransmission because of the packet loss. DAT aims to improve this
mechanism and to increase the ARP dialogue reliability.

h2. The idea

The DAT core mechanism consists in storing the content of all the ARP replies that travel over the network on a specific set of nodes. Given an IP address, the set containing its related ARP reply is known to every other mesh participant. In this way, whenever a client issues an ARP request, the mesh node can intercept and forward it directly to the nodes belonging to the specific set where the corresponding reply is stored. Requests are sent as unicast packets and therefore the probability of losing the packet decreases with respect to the common case.

h2. Enable/Disable DAT

DAT can be compiled in the final binary by means of the customizable Makefile
option or can be left out to save binary space (in the out-of-the-kernel-tree package DAT is built-in by default).

h2. Inspecting the Local DAT table

Since DAT is a network wide cache, each node stores a little piece of this big table. To see what entries the node is currectly storing in the DAT local cache, it is possible to use the following command:
<pre>
# batctl dat
</pre>
