h1. Basic Multicast Optimizations

The current multicast optimizations in batman-adv provides a basic infrastructure for multicast awareness and reduced multicast overhead in some setups.

So far, this basic optimization reduces overhead in the following two ways:

*_Discards IPv4/IPv6 packets with no multicast listener:_*

*_Forwards IPv4/IPv6 packets with a single multicast listener via unicast:_*

If there is more than one receiver or if there is a node with a Linux bridge on top of its batman-adv interface, then packets are flooded as it was done so far:
