h1. Basic Multicast Optimizations

h2. Overview

The current multicast optimizations in batman-adv provides a basic infrastructure for multicast awareness and reduced multicast overhead in some setups.

So far, this basic optimization reduces overhead in the following two ways:

h3. Discards IPv4/IPv6 packets with no multicast listener

batman-adv detects whether there are any potential IPv4/IPv6 multicast listeners interested in traffic to the according multicast destination address. If not then the packet is never forwarded into the mesh network.

h3. Forwards IPv4/IPv6 packets with a single multicast listener via unicast

If a single multicast listener was detected then the packet is forwarded directly to the according batman-adv node.


h3. Limitations

In the following cases multicast packets are still distributed via classic flooding:

* If there is more than one listener for a specific multicast group.
* If there is a node with a Linux bridge on top of its batman-adv interface.
* If the multicast packets have a scope greater than link-local.

(These things are work in progress and will be supported at a later time.)


h2. How to activate the basic multicast optimizations?

By default they are activated. You can force the old behaviour, classic flooding of all multicast frames, on a certain node via the following command, executed as root (here: bat0):

<pre>echo 0 > /sys/class/net/bat0/mesh/multicast_mode</pre>

Note: This only affects multicast traffic originating from this specific node.
