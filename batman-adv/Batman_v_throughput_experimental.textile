h1. B.A.T.M.A.N. V

*Metric:* Bandwitdh instead of packet loss
*Link/Neighbour Discovery:* [[ELP|ELP (Echo Locating Protocol)]]
*Routing table construction:* OGMv3

h2. Bandwidth estimation

* *wireless*: maximum throughput from rc_stats (number 1)
* *wired*: ethtool for half/full duplex and theoretical bandwidth (this may be falsified by Ethernet bridges in the LAN)
* *VPN*: 1Mbps, configurable via sysfs
* *Unknown*: 1Mbps
* *generic*: the [[bandwidth_meter_protocol|bandwidth meter]] might be used to estimate the real (current) throughtput on non-wireless interfaces
