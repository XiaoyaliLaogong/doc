h1. How to Interconnect different Batman-adv clouds (DRAFT)

h2. Overview

* Use case scenario (picture).
* Need to combine intra and iter-cloud metrics.
* Use batman-adv over both intra and inter connections to get metric combination for free.
* Layer-3 routing protocol to exchange metrics
* Layer-3 routing daemon and DHCP interaction for intra-cloud subnets advertisement
* GW feature for global route decision

h2. Layer-2 Anycast

The macvlan kernel module can be used to create several virtual interfaces on top of an already existent one. These new interfaces can have a user defined MAC address and will not apply any tagging (like a normal VLAN interface would do). This is an example on how to create a virtual interface on top of another one:
<pre>
# ip link add link bat0 name veth0 type macvlan
</pre>
