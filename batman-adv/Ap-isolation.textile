h3. What is it?

Like any commercial Access Point, the "Access Point Isolation" is that feature which prevent any communication between stations connected to the same infrastructured BSSID. B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced replicates the same behaviour by denying communications between clients connected to their nodes through a wireless link. Note that communications from and to clients connected through a WIRED link are left untouched.

h3. How to enable it?

<pre>
batctl ap_isolation 1
</pre>
or
<pre>
batctl ap 1
</pre>
To disable it, just switch 1 to 0

Note that packets are checked either at the sender and at the receiver node, therefore, if at least one of those enabled the AP-Isolation, the communication is forbidden. However we strongly suggest to enable the AP-Isolation on all the nodes in order to prevent wasting of resources (e.g. send of data over the mesh knowing that it is going to be dropped at the receiver)
