h3. What is it?

Like any commercial Access Point, the "Access Point Isolation" is a feature that prevents any communication between stations connected to the same infrastructured BSSID. B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced replicates the same behaviour by denying communication between clients connected to their nodes through a wireless link. Note that communication from and to clients connected through a wired link is left untouched.

The picture above shows a simple scenario where AP-Isolation is enabled either on node A and B: communications between wireless stations are prevented, while communications between wireless and wired clients are allowed.

h3. How to enable it?

<pre>
batctl ap_isolation 1
</pre>
or
<pre>
batctl ap 1
</pre>
To disable it, just switch 1 to 0

Note that packets are checked either at the sender or the receiver node, therefore, if at least one of those have AP-Isolation enabled, the communication is forbidden. However we strongly suggest to enable the AP-Isolation on all the nodes in order to prevent wasting of resources. (E.g. send of data over the mesh knowing that it is going to be dropped at the receiver)

Remember that B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced AP-Isolation will provide "inter-meshnode communications" prevention only. Therefore if you want to block communications between clients connected to the same access point (actually mesh node) you may want to enable the "class AP-Isolation" function provided by the access point itself.
