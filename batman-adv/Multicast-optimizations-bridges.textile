h1. Multicast Optimizations with Bridges

So far, the batman-adv multicast optimizations were only enabled if no bridges were involved in the whole mesh network.

For someone wanting to use the multicast optimizations feature in batman-adv, multicast listeners would only be possible directly on a batman-adv node, on the same kernel:

Now it is also possible to use this feature with bridges:

A batman-adv node is able to detect any multicast listener on a foreign, non-mesh device behind a bridge, too:

For this batman-adv interacts with the IGMP/MLD snooping feature of the Linux bridge: A Linux bridge already detects multicast listeners through snooping IGMP and MLD messages, which a multicast listener regularly sends.

batman-adv is capable of fetching that information from a Linux bridge in kernels newer or equal to 3.16. With older kernels a batman-adv node will inform other nodes that it needs any multicast data and will receive such packets.
