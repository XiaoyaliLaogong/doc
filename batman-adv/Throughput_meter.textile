BANDWIDTH METER

A tool to measure throughput between two nodes. To avoid problems experienced with user space tools like iperf and netperf, it is developed in kernel space. Two modes are implemented:

* udp-like: one directional, no retransmission, stream of data;
** How to ensure that all data was transmitted
** How do we ensure that the last packet/magic packets were not transmitted out of order
** how does the remote node gets informed that test finished even when *many* packets are dropped

* tcp-like:  in this mode the behaviour of tcp should be re-created. We should verify if it is possible to use the existing, standard, tcp implementation or if it is needed to develop a tcp-like (simpler...) protocol just for this application.


FIRST SPECIFICATION

As of May 2, me, Ordex, Simon and Marek agreed on the following:

# the "TCP" version will be developed first;

# the protocol will be a "Go-Back-N":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-back-N: so sliding window, cumulative acknowledgment. _Further protocol definition_ soon; this is intended as a rough approximation of TCP behaviour;

# The user specify how much data the bandwidth meter is intended to send in the session; once the transmission is completed (i.e. all the data is received by the sender) the transmission time is reported. _Further details on protocol header formats, time computation_ soon; It should allow:
## Possibility to specify if the node is sender or receiver (data flow direction);
## Possibility to add others operation modes later (e.g. "UDP" mode);
## Integrated in the batman ICMP protocol;
