BANDWIDTH METER

A tool to measure throughput between two nodes. To avoid problems experienced with user space tools like iperf and netperf, it is developed in kernel space. Two modes are implemented:

* udp-like: one directional, no retransmission, stream of data;

* tcp-like:  in this mode the behaviour of tcp should be re-created. We should verify if it is possible to use the existing, standard, tcp implementation or if it is needed to develop a tcp-like (simpler...) protocol just for this application.
