h1. Roaming-improvements

h2. Speeding up the roaming

The base idea consists in exploiting the new forwarding mechanism for data packets described in the [[Client-announcement]] page in order to reduce the interruption time a non-mesh client experiences when moving from one mesh node to the next. This procedure of a non-mesh client switching to a new mesh node is called "roaming". At its core it simply is a synchronization issue: Whenever roaming occurs the new mesh node "parent" needs to inform the entire mesh that a particular non-mesh client is now to be found at a new location. Even under ideal conditions it might take a full originator interval in which the client is not reachable at all. The bigger the mesh, the higher the packetloss or originator interval the longer the client has to wait before it can use the network again.

The main idea behind the roaming improvements is to make use of the fact that batman-adv has full control over the payload traffic traveling through the mesh network. In particular, with this mechanism the packet destination is modified along the path, if needed, as the message reaches an up-to-date router. If so data packet is rerouted to the new destination and information in the packet header are updated too (destination and ttvn field) until the mesh network is in sync again. In addition, a roaming advertisement packet is sent to immediately inform the old originator that the client has moved and that it is now located on another node. This message can be seen as an asynchronous update that permits the old node to redirect data packets as soon as they reach it.

h2. Detect a roaming client

To detect whether a recently detected non-mesh client is a roaming client or a new client, it is sufficient to search the global translation table for the clients mac address. In case of positive match (the same MAC address is already in the table but pointing to another mesh node) the node has to send a roaming advertisement message to the old mesh node to inform it about the roaming event.

The roaming advertisement format:
* Packet type: Initialize this field with the ROAM_ADV packet type.
* Version: Set your internal compatibility version.
* Destination Address: Address of the host this packet should be forwarded to.
* TTL: Time-To-Live field decreased by with one with each hop. Packet is to be discarded when counter reaches 0.
* Source Address: Address of the host sending this message.
* Client Address: Address of the roaming client that the source node has to communicate to the destination one in order to update the global translation table.

These information are used to update the old node's global table so that, in case of payload packet directed to him while the network is not in sync, with a payload destination equal to 'client address is redirected to 'source address'.

Due to this mechanism, immediately after a roaming the data packets might follow a slightly sub-optimal path (data flow is going through the old node) until the network is in sync again and every node has updated its global translation table. This strategy will help to avoid losing packets that are still flowing to the old node.

h2. Routing data packets

The enhanced data routing is built on top of the data routing procedure described in the [[Client-announcement]] page. When a mesh node receives a roaming advertisement concerning one of its former non-mesh clients it will mark the client entry with the roaming flag. The mesh node sending the roaming advertisement will do the same. This extra flag is needed as long as the translation tables are not in sync and will have to be deactivated once an OGM with the new ttvn arrives. 

When payload data reaches either node (new or old mesh node) they will not only check if the translation table version number (ttvn) of the destination host is outdated but also check if the roaming flag is active. If one of the conditions is met the payload traffic is rerouted if necessary.  

h2. Translation table consistency

As described in the [[Client-announcement|client announcement document]] each node computes a crc16 checksum value and floods it through the network using OGMs. In case of roaming, a temporary inconsistent global table could lead to a wrong crc16 checksum value computed on the nodes making them issue a new TT_REQUEST.

In particular, a node receiving a roaming advertisement message will track this change as a simple removal and will send it within the next OGM. The receiver node has to **do not delete** this client immediately, otherwise it will lose any route towards it.
So the idea is to keep the client entry in the nodes global tables. By the way this solution could lead to an inconsistent state: if client C roams from A to B, A won't have C in its local table any more, but nodes keeping this entry pointing to A will then compute a wrong (global) tt_crc value for A (they are using C in the computation).

To solve this issue, a new flags field has been added to the tt_change and the tt_global_entry structure. In particular, every **delete** change generated by a roaming event will have the TT_CHANGE_ROAM bit set so that receiving node can set the corresponding TT_GLOBAL_ROAM flag in the tt_global_entry it is going to modify/create. This flag will slightly modify the tt_crc computation for global tables: entry with TT_GLOBAL_ROAM set will not be used for the computation to reflect the state of the originator's local table keeping a valid route to clients at the same time.

The TT_GLOBAL_ROAM in the tt_global_entry structure will be reset to 0 as soon as a new OGM containing an **add** event for that client is received.

h2. Limitations

* MAC conflict: In case of more than one node announcing the same client MAC address, each node will interpret this situation as a "continued roaming" and will start sending roaming advertisement messages multiple times. To reduce the impact of this problematic scenario a roaming-protection has been provided: A client can roam on the same node a fixed amount of times in a fixed length period (look into main.h for the exact values). In case of exceeding the limit, the interested node will not issue any new roaming advertisement unless the protection period is terminated.

* multiple roaming in one OGM interval: In case of a node roaming from node A to B a roaming advertisement is sent from B to A, but if the client moves again from node B to C, before B issued a new OGM, C will send the roaming advertisement to A again! This happens because C doesn't know anything yet about the last client movement. *A possible solution to this problem could consist in implementing a roaming advertisement forwarding procedure that in scenarios like this make the roaming advertisement message going through all the steps the client did.
