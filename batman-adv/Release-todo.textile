* master branch is closed whenever net-next is closed
* master branch is released as feature release 20_ _.a after net-next is closed (whenever Linus released a final Linux version)
** actually only the patches which were really submitted should be released (when possible)
* maint branch is released on demand
** for example after security issues
** when net.git/Linux was released with important fixes and users cannot switch to new feature release (which is done at the same time)
