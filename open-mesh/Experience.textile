This page aims to document and link to experience with the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol in real live scenarios.
If you have made some experience or even setup a B.A.T.M.A.N. mesh network at someplace in this universe please feel urged to [wiki:MailingList tell us] or drop us a link!

 * An experimental 20-nodes B.A.T.M.A.N and OLSR testbed has been setup at the Wireless Community Weekend 2007 in Graz / Austria. More information is [wiki:WCWGraz2007 here]
 * B.A.T.M.A.N. in Leipzig, also providing a huge number of howtos, documentation, and experience reports! Check out: http://wiki.leipzig.freifunk.net/BATMAN
