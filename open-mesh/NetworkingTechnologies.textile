Batmand and batman advanced rely on underlining network transport technologies like WIFI for instance.
This page explains the interaction between them and batmand or batmand-adv.

h2. Batmand and IBSS
IBSS(also known as ad-hoc) permit the connection of more than two devices together in a big IBSS network.
Let's say you have 3 devices A,B and C connected that way: A<->B<->C with:
* C being out of the range of A
* A and B being in range
* B and C being in range
* A,B,C having the same SSID(it's called BSSID in IBSS networks)
Batmand will simply route the packets from A to C
