
= Using the batman git repository =

If you want to find out why we also have a git repository now, please read [wiki:BatmanGoesMainline here].

=== Checkout ===

To retrieve the latest changes you can pull from the read-only http frontend.[[BR]]
Your are about to download 300MB of sources - that may take a while!

{{{
git clone http://git.open-mesh.org/batman-adv/ batman-adv-git
}}}

=== Branches ===

The git repository is divided into several branches to make working easier.[[BR]]

'''master branch'''

The master branch is a clone of the batman kernel module SVN found at [[BR]]
http://downloads.open-mesh.org/svn/batman/trunk/batman-adv-kernelland/ [[BR]]

The idea is that all kernel changes are built on top of the SVN, so that[[BR]]
changes which affect all branches can easily trickle down. A post-commit[[BR]]
script makes sure that the SVN  is in sync with the git master branch all the[[BR]]
time.[[BR]]

In fact you will never work with this branch itself but one of the other branches.[[BR]]

'''linux branch'''

The linux branch is a clone of Linus Torvalds developer branch. With the help[[BR]]
of some git vodoo the master branch is merged with this branch in the folder:[[BR]]
drivers/staging/batman-adv/. If you wish to merge the latest master branch [[BR]]
changes into the linux branch you need to switch to the linux branch:[[BR]]

{{{
git checkout linux
}}}

and merge the master branch into this one:

{{{
git fetch origin
git merge -s subtree origin/master
}}}

If you wish to pull Linus latest changes and merge it you need to add the remote[[BR]]
branch first (you can omit that step if you already have it).

{{{
git remote add torvalds git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
}}}

Fetch its content and merge it:

{{{
git checkout linux
git fetch torvalds
git merge torvalds/master
}}}

To upload your changes you need to run:
{{{
git checkout linux
git push origin linux
}}}


'''difference between SVN and git'''

If you need to see the difference between the SVN repos and the batman-adv[[BR]]
driver in drivers/staging/batman-adv/ you can run this command:

{{{
git diff origin/master: linux:drivers/staging/batman-adv/
}}}


'''adding a branch'''

In case you want to add your own branch for testing purposes or simply wish[[BR]]
to understand the magic.

{{{
git remote add $remote_name $git_url
git fetch $remote_name

git checkout -b $new_branch_name $remote_name/master
git merge -s ours --no-commit master
git read-tree --prefix=drivers/staging/batman-adv/ -u master
git commit -m "Add batman-adv to my new branch"
}}}

=== TODO ===

We maintain a TODO file in the git repository that you can see here: 

[[Include(http://git.open-mesh.org/TODO.html)]]

If you are interested in helping us out you can grab one item, make a patch[[BR]]
and send it to our [wiki:MailingList Mailinglist].
