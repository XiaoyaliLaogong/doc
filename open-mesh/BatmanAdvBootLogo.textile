h1. Batman-adv boot logo

If you are a very batman-advanced addicted and enthusiastic fan, you will surely want to give the B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced boot logo a try! This little howto will drive you through the few necessary steps that will enable you to select a new custom logo from the kernel menuconfig.

This is what it looks like at the end:

!batlogo_boot_screenshort_400px.jpg!

Do you like it? Yeah! So, these are the necessary steps (it works for linux-3.3.2, but should work for older versions as well):

1. download the logo (attachment:logo_batman_clut224.ppm) and put it into your _drivers/video/logo_ subfolder in the kernel source directory

2. download the patch (attachment:batman_logo.patch) and put it into your kernel source directory

3. open a terminal, jump into your kernel source directory and type
<pre>
patch -p1 < batman_logo.patch
</pre>

4. now run the menuconfig by typing
<pre>
make menuconfig
</pre>

5. Browse the menu: Device Drivers -> Graphics support -> Bootup Logo and choose the new B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced entry:

!batman_logo_menu.png!

6. Exit the menu and recompile your kernel! Don't forget to reinstall it to the proper location!

Enjoy!
