If you are a very batman-advanced-addicted and enthusiastic fan, you will surely want to try the B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced bootup logo out!!

If you want to see the B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced logo each time your laptop boot up this wikipage is made for you!

This little howto will drive you through a few steps that will enable you to select a new custom logo from the kernel menuconfig.
This is the final result:

!batlogo_boot_screenshort_400px.jpg!

Do you like it? Yeah! So, these are the vey short steps (it works for linux-3.3.2, but should work for older versions as well):

1) download the logo (logo_batman_clut224.ppm) and put it into your _drivers/video/logo_ subfolder in the kernel source directory

2) download the patch (batman_logo.patch) and put it into your kernel source directory

3) open a terminal, jump into your kernel source directory and type
<pre>
# patch -p1 <batman_logo.patch
</pre>

4) now run the menuconfig by typing
<pre>
# make menuconfig
</pre>

5) Browse the menu: Device Drivers -> Graphics support -> Bootup Logo and choose the new B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced entry:

!batman_logo_menu.png!

6) Exit the menu and recompile your kernel! Don't forget to reinstall it to the proper location!
