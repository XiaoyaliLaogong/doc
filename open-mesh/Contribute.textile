publish them here or link to your page. If you are looking for the right topic or [[BR]]

=== Submitting patches ===

If you intend to send us patches, please consider the following guidelines:

 * Prefer small & digestible over long "all in one" patches.
 * The mails subject will become the first line in the commit message. The body [[BR]]
   contains the longer patch description and the patch (unified format) itself. [[BR]]
   Please also specify the target branch (e.g. [batman], [batctl], etc) at the [[BR]]
   beginning of the subject line. See the [http://www.open-mesh.org/timeline timeline] for more examples.
 * Add a "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you @ example.com>" line to the commit [[BR]]
   message to make the ownership of the patch clear.
