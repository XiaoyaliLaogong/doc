=== Research ===

B.A.T.M.A.N. gives much room for research, especially the layer 2 implementation in the kernel. Get in touch with us to share your ideas. If you write papers we are happy to publish them here or link to your page. If you are looking for the right topic or mentorship feel free to contact us. We have more ideas than time to implement them.

=== Development ===

You looked in the code ? Fixed bugs ? Added a cool new function ? Integrated B.A.T.M.A.N. in a distribution ? Don't hesitate to let us and others know! We can avoid duplicated work by publishing it here or linking to your page. Patches are always welcome and can be posted on the [wiki:MailingList mailing list] to get integrated. We also hand out SVN/git access to people that want to get involved.

=== Submitting patches ===

If you intend to send us patches, please consider the following guidelines:

 * Prefer small & digestible over long "all in one" patches.
 * No MIME, no links, no compression, no attachments.  Just plain text (patches are to be sent inline).
 * Patches sent to the mailing list should include "PATCH" in the subject to make it easier to distinguish between patches and discussions.
 * The mail's subject will become the first line in the commit message. The body contains the longer patch description and the patch (unified format) itself. Please also specify the target branch (e.g. batctl, batman-adv, etc) at the beginning of the subject line. See the [http://www.open-mesh.org/timeline timeline] for more examples.
 * Add a "Signed-off-by: Your Name <!you@example.com>" line to the patch message to make the ownership of the patch clear.
 * Patches for B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced need to follow the linux kernel coding style closely (use checkpatch.pl to verify your patch) as well as the linux "how to submit patches" guidelines (search for the term !SubmitPatches to find thorough documentation).
 * An exemplary good submission you may want to look at can be found here: https://lists.open-mesh.org/pipermail/b.a.t.m.a.n/2009-December/002033.html
