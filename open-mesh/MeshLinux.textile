*Linux distribution geared to build mesh supernodes - routers with many wireless interfaces and plenty CPU power on X86 platform*

Meshlinux is outdated and really old. The project hasn't been updated in a long time. It is unlikely that anyone will take up development on it again. We recommend to use OpenWrt for X86 platform. 

Nothing is as outdated as old software. Meshlinux was created in the early days of mesh networking at the Freifunk community in 2004. It is a CD-Image that can be used to convert old PCs into wireless supernodes. There is a old Meshlinux version based on Linux (Kernel 2.4.26) available at (http://wiki.c-base.org/coredump/MeshLinux) This old version is based on Slackware and not maintained anymore. However it works nicely with old Atmel USB wireless devices (which is a problem nowadays with recent kernels), Prism-based Chipsets and Orinoco. But you won't find any modern mesh routing protocol implementations in it. If you want to build a meshrouter with this kind of wireless devices you may still use it and install a recent version of Layer 3 B.A.T.M.A.N. - you can download a statically compiled version from this server. You can not use Batman-advanced, since this would require a recent Linux kernel. Some userland mesh protocol daemon might still work with it.

Sooner or later this information will be removed.
