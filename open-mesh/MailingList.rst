Mailing List
============

You can subscribe to our Mailing Lists
`here <https://lists.open-mesh.org/>`__. You can also send an E-Mail
without subscription to b.a.t.m.a.n@lists.open-mesh.org, but keep in
mind that this message will have to be accepted manually (and this can
take some time).

*Note*: HTML email will be rejected - just plain text is allowed (this
cuts the rate of SPAM mails dramatically).

Old messages can be read in the `B.A.T.M.A.N.
archives <https://lists.open-mesh.org/pipermail/b.a.t.m.a.n/>`__.
