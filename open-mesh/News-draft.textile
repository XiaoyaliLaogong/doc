h1. DRAFT: Batman-adv 2017.3 released

Sep 28th, 2017. Today the B.A.T.M.A.N. team publishes the September 2017 update to batman-adv, batctl and alfred! A long standing problem in batman-adv was fixed that could lead to an excessive number of TT management packets when devices disagree about the enabled flags of a device in the translation table. The memory usage of alfred was reduced slightly when it is used with <code>--update-command</code> and receives a lot of updates. Also minor bugfixes and code cleanups are included in this version.

As the kernel module always depends on the Linux kernel it is compiled against, it does not make sense to provide binaries on our website. As usual, you will find the signed tarballs in our download section:
