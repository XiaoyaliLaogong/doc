h1. DRAFT: Batman-adv 2017.4 released

Dec 05th, 2017. Today the B.A.T.M.A.N. team publishes the December 2017 update to batman-adv, batctl and alfred! This release contains mostly bugfixes, code cleanups and documentation updates.

As the kernel module always depends on the Linux kernel it is compiled against, it does not make sense to provide binaries on our website. As usual, you will find the signed tarballs in our download section:
