h1. DRAFT: Batman-adv 2017.0 released

Feb 28th, 2017. Today the B.A.T.M.A.N. team publishes the February 2017 update to batman-adv, batctl and alfred! This release reduces the number of cases in which batctl depends on running with full root user privileges. Bridge loop avoidance addresses are removed from the translation table to lower its memory usage. The batman-adv compatibility code was optimized to better work with old kernel versions and to build B.A.T.M.A.N. V (without wifi throughput detection) on pre-3.16 kernels. alfred gained an experimental mode to support data synchronization over IPv4 instead of IPv6. Also several bugfixes and code cleanups are included in this version.

As the kernel module always depends on the Linux kernel it is compiled against, it does not make sense to provide binaries on our website. As usual, you will find the signed tarballs in our download section:

https://downloads.open-mesh.org/batman/releases/batman-adv-2017.0/

as well as prepackaged binaries in your distribution.
