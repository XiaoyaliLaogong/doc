h1. Research Proposals on B.A.T.M.A.N.-Advanced


h2. Documentation & Performance evaluation

* DHT / DAT
* B.A.T.M.A.N. V - ELP / OGM, half duplex vs full duplex
* Multi-radio
* Multicast flooding
* batman packet format documentation, flags, chachacha
* TT



h2. Extending the protocol

* IPv6 gateway enhancements
* B.A.T.M.A.N. V future:
** RIP
** unicast OGM 


h2. fancy stuff

* anycast
* multicast over DHT
* dynamic OGM interval



h3. Fast dead link detection or Fast link switching

Would also improve mobility

h3. Security/Authentication

Adding a security and authentication layer to protect batman
messages from malicious or malfunctioning nodes.

h3. Distributed filtering

Packet filtering in ad-hoc and mesh networks can help to define
different user profiles, reduce the impact of unwanted traffic and
make the network more robust to attacks. The problem of implementing a
network-wide filtering policy to be enforced in all the mesh nodes
with user-level granularity must still be resolved since the diffusion
of rule-sets and their enforcement has a great impact in a
resource-limited networks both for the generated traffic and the
computation required.
