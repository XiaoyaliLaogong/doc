\subsection{Why the B.A.T.M.A.N. daemon doesn't reload the setting after I fixed the main IP?}
You have to restart the B.A.T.M.A.N. daemon after you modified any network
configuration, otherwise the B.A.T.M.A.N. daemon won't use the new settings.
\begin{verbatim}
 $ killall batmand
 $ batmand eth1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Why I can't connect to the Internet after setting the default gateway?}
You have to use NAT on your gateway or firewall if you use the -r or -p options
to set default route.
\begin{verbatim}
 $ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
\end{verbatim}
Note that you don't set the default route by yourself.
